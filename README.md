# Landing Page Website

Hello, this is a quick version of the landing page website I created. The original design that I was trying to create can be found here: (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)[original design].

The majority of this webpage utilizes flex to control where content is. I did the best I could to mimic the page, however if there are suggestions as to how to mimic it better, please let me know!

Thanks,
Austin
